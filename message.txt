# Dear Ahlam,


Just wanted to drop you a quick note to remind you that you're such an awesome, beautiful, stunning, amazing, gorgeous, jaw dropping actual angel girl, love you to bits! Our fights might be loud, but they don't change how much I care about you. No matter what, you really mean the world to me, and I hate it when we're not on good terms. Thanks for being the coolest sis ever and putting up with all my crap! Mwah!


Love you always, 




Joc
